But it's not just his deadly accuracy that sets him apart; Paelias is convinced that lurking monsters are everywhere, from the shadowy forest to the bottom of his tankard. In fact, he once shot an innocent mushroom, fearing it might be a fungal infiltrator. Beware, for his crossbow deals d6 damage wherever he goes, be it at the dinner table or on the dance floor.","As a cleric, Paelias channels divine magic for the gods, but his prayers often sound more like negotiations. He's as greedy as a dragon when it comes to treasure, ready to trade even his elven dignity for a shiny bauble. In fact, he once offered to heal a goblin's sore ankle in exchange for a particularly sparkly rock.","Paelias is a crucial member of the Rusty Saw, a band of adventurers who double as musicians. He's the one in the back with a crossbow at the ready and a trombone slung over his shoulder, just in case the monsters break out into song. In the world of Dungeons and Dragons, Paelias is the paranoid, treasure-hungry cleric with a crossbow that deals d6 damage and a heart that gleams like a dragon's horde."],"comments":[{"postID":4,"commentID":1,"depth":1,"author":"Paelias","avatar":"default","datePosted":1697869710,"comment":["IT's A d10 CROSSBOW!!!! not d6"]}]}
