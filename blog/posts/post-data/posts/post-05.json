Not only is he the comic relief and saw-wielding sensation of The Rusty Saw, but he also serves as the unlikely and endearing sidekick to the dashing elf, Cleric Paelias.","Cleric, with his elvish grace and heroic charm, is the very picture of an ideal fantasy hero. He possesses the wisdom of the ages, a razor-sharp sword, and impeccable hair. Thumblebut, on the other hand, limps his way through life and leaves puddles of laughter in his wake.","The pair's dynamic is a sight to behold. While Cleric delivers epic speeches and engages in grand quests, Thumblebut tags along with his own brand of heroics - heroic in the sense that his antics are sure to make you roll on the floor laughing. Whether they're infiltrating a goblin stronghold or outwitting cunning sorcerers, Cleric's poised valor and Thumblebut's slapstick humor make for an unforgettable team.","In a city where legends are born and destinies intertwine, Cleric and Thumblebut stand as a testament to the magic of unlikely friendships. So, in the enchanting realm of Waterdeep, keep an eye out for this mismatched duo, for their adventures are sure to be as unpredictable as a goblin's bladder on a hot summer day."],"comments":[{"postID":5,"commentID":1,"depth":1,"author":"Heman","avatar":"default","datePosted":1697791950,"comment":["Hi Jo King. This was very inspiring and helpful for my D&D campaign. As well I do believe that you are missing an I at the start of your introductory sentence."]}]}
